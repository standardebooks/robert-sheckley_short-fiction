<div class="bk1"><p><big><b>Compared with a spaceship in distress, going
to hell in a handbasket is roomy and slow!</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> space freighter <i>Queen
Dierdre</i> was a great, squat,
pockmarked vessel of the
Earth-Mars run and she never
gave anyone a bit of trouble. That
should have been sufficient warning
to Mr. Watkins, her engineer.
Watkins was fond of saying
that there are two kinds of equipment&mdash;the
kind that fails bit by
bit, and the kind that fails all at
once.</p>

<p>Watkins was short and red-faced,
magnificently mustached,
and always a little out of breath.
With a cigar in his hand, over a
glass of beer, he talked most cynically
about his ship, in the immemorial
fashion of engineers.
But in reality, Watkins was foolishly
infatuated with <i>Dierdre</i>,
idealized her, humanized her, and
couldn't conceive of anything serious
ever happening.</p>

<p>On this particular run, <i>Dierdre</i>
soared away from Terra at the
proper speed; Mr. Watkins signaled
that fuel was being consumed
at the proper rate; and
Captain Somers cut the engines
at the proper moment indicated
by Mr. Rajcik, the navigator.</p>

<p>As soon as Point Able had
been reached and the engines
stopped, Somers frowned and
studied his complex control
board. He was a thin and meticulous
man, and he operated his
ship with mechanical perfection.
He was well liked in the front
offices of Mikkelsen Space Lines,
where Old Man Mikkelsen pointed
to Captain Somers' reports as
models of neatness and efficiency.
On Mars, he stayed at the Officers'
Club, eschewing the stews and
dives of Marsport. On Earth, he
lived in a little Vermont cottage
and enjoyed the quiet companionship
of two cats, a Japanese
houseboy, and a wife.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">His</span> instructions read true. And
yet he sensed something
wrong. Somers knew every creak,
rattle and groan that <i>Dierdre</i>
was capable of making. During
blastoff, he had heard something
<i>different</i>. In space, something different
had to be wrong.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rajcik," he said, turning
to his navigator, "would you
check the cargo? I believe something
may have shifted."</p>

<p>"You bet," Rajcik said cheerfully.
He was an almost offensively
handsome young man with
black wavy hair, blas&eacute; blue eyes
and a cleft chin. Despite his appearance,
Rajcik was thoroughly
qualified for his position. But he
was only one of fifty thousand
thoroughly qualified men who
lusted for a berth on one of the
fourteen spaceships in existence.
Only Stephen Rajcik had had the
foresight, appearance and fortitude
to court and wed Helga, Old
Man Mikkelsen's eldest daughter.</p>

<p>Rajcik went aft to the cargo
hold. <i>Dierdre</i> was carrying transistors
this time, and microfilm
books, platinum filaments, salamis,
and other items that could
not as yet be produced on Mars.
But the bulk of her space was
taken by the immense Fahrensen
Computer.</p>

<p>Rajcik checked the positioning
lines on the monster, examined
the stays and turnbuckles
that held it in place, and returned
to the cabin.</p>

<p>"All in order, Boss," he reported
to Captain Somers, with the
smile that only an employer's
son-in-law can both manage and
afford.</p>

<p>"Mr. Watkins, do you read
anything?"</p>

<p>Watkins was at his own instrument
panel. "Not a thing, sir. I'll
vouch for every bit of equipment
in <i>Dierdre</i>."</p>

<p>"Very well. How long before
we reach Point Baker?"</p>

<p>"Three minutes, Chief," Rajcik
said.</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>The spaceship hung in the
void, all sensation of speed lost
for lack of a reference point. Beyond
the portholes was darkness,
the true color of the Universe,
perforated by the brilliant lost
points of the stars.</p>

<p>Captain Somers turned away
from the disturbing reminder of
his extreme finitude and wondered
if he could land <i>Dierdre</i>
without shifting the computer. It
was by far the largest, heaviest
and most delicate piece of equipment
ever transported in space.</p>

<p>He worried about that machine.
Its value ran into the billions
of dollars, for Mars Colony
had ordered the best possible, a
machine whose utility would offset
the immense transportation
charge across space. As a result,
the Fahrensen Computer was perhaps
the most complex and advanced
machine ever built by
Man.</p>

<p>"Ten seconds to Point Baker,"
Rajcik announced.</p>

<p>"Very well." Somers readied
himself at the control board.</p>

<p>"Four&mdash;three&mdash;two&mdash;one&mdash;fire!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Somers</span> activated the engines.
Acceleration pressed the three
men back into their couches, and
more acceleration, and&mdash;shockingly&mdash;still
more acceleration.</p>

<p>"The fuel!" Watkins yelped,
watching his indicators spinning.</p>

<p>"The course!" Rajcik gasped,
fighting for breath.</p>

<p>Captain Somers cut the engine
switch. The engines continued
firing, pressing the men deeper
into their couches. The cabin
lights flickered, went out, came
on again.</p>

<p>And still the acceleration
mounted and <i>Dierdre's</i> engines
howled in agony, thrusting the
ship forward. Somers raised one
leaden hand and inched it toward
the emergency cut-off
switch. With a fantastic expenditure
of energy, he reached the
switch, depressed it.</p>

<p>The engines stopped with dramatic
suddenness, while tortured
metal creaked and groaned. The
lights flickered rapidly, as though
<i>Dierdre</i> were blinking in pain.
They steadied and then there was
silence.</p>

<p>Watkins hurried to the engine
room. He returned morosely.</p>

<p>"Of all the damn things," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"What was it?" Captain Somers
asked.</p>

<p>"Main firing circuit. It fused
on us." He shook his head. "Metal
fatigue, I'd say. It must have
been flawed for years."</p>

<p>"When was it last checked
out?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's a sealed unit. Supposed
to outlast the ship. Absolutely
foolproof, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless it's flawed."</p>

<p>"Don't blame it on me! Those
circuits are supposed to be X-rayed,
heat-treated, fluoroscoped&mdash;you
just can't trust machinery!"</p>

<p>At last Watkins believed that
engineering axiom.</p>

<p>"How are we on fuel?" Captain
Somers asked.</p>

<p>"Not enough left to push a
kiddy car down Main Street,"
Watkins said gloomily. "If I could
get my hands on that factory inspector ..."</p>

<p>Captain Somers turned to Rajcik,
who was seated at the navigator's
desk, hunched over his
charts. "How does this affect our
course?"</p>

<p>Rajcik finished the computation
he was working on and
gnawed thoughtfully at his pencil.</p>

<p>"It kills us. We're going to
cross the orbit of Mars before
Mars gets there."</p>

<p>"How long before?"</p>

<p>"Too long. Captain, we're flying
out of the Solar System like
the proverbial bat out of hell."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Rajcik</span> smiled, a courageous,
devil-may-care smile which
Watkins found singularly inappropriate.</p>

<p>"Damn it, man," he roared,
"don't just leave it there. We've
got a little fuel left. We can turn
her, can't we? You <i>are</i> a navigator,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I am," Rajcik said icily. "And
if I computed my courses the
way you maintain your engines,
we'd be plowing through Australia
now."</p>

<p>"Why, you little company
toady! At least I got my job legitimately,
not by marrying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough!" Captain Somers
cut in.</p>

<p>Watkins, his face a mottled red,
his mustache bristling, looked like
a walrus about to charge. And
Rajcik, eyes glittering, was waiting
hopefully.</p>

<p>"No more of this," Somers said.
"I give the orders here."</p>

<p>"Then give some!" Watkins
snapped. "Tell him to plot a return
curve. This is life or death!"</p>

<p>"All the more reason for remaining
cool. Mr. Rajcik, can
you plot such a course?"</p>

<p>"First thing I tried," Rajcik
said. "Not a chance, on the fuel
we have left. We can turn a degree
or two, but it won't help."</p>

<p>Watkins said, "Of course it will!
We'll curve back into the Solar
System!"</p>

<p>"Sure, but the best curve we
can make will take a few thousand
years for us to complete."</p>

<p>"Perhaps a landfall on some
other planet&mdash;Neptune, Uranus&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rajcik shook his head. "Even
if an outer planet were in the
right place at the right time, we'd
need fuel&mdash;a lot of fuel&mdash;to get
into a braking orbit. And if we
could, who'd come get us? No
ship has gone past Mars yet."</p>

<p>"At least we'd have a chance,"
Watkins said.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Rajcik agreed indifferently.
"But we can't swing it.
I'm afraid you'll have to kiss the
Solar System good-by."</p>

<p>Captain Somers wiped his forehead
and tried to think of a plan.
He found it difficult to concentrate.
There was too great a discrepancy
between his knowledge
of the situation and its appearance.
He knew&mdash;intellectually&mdash;that
his ship was traveling out of
the Solar System at a tremendous
rate of speed. But in appearance
they were stationary, hung in the
abyss, three men trapped in a
small, hot room, breathing the
smell of hot metal and perspiration.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Captain?"
Watkins asked.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Somers</span> frowned at the engineer.
Did the man expect him
to pull a solution out of the air?
How was he even supposed to
concentrate on the problem? He
had to slow the ship, turn it. But
his senses told him that the ship
was not moving. How, then, could
speed constitute a problem?</p>

<p>He couldn't help but feel that
the real problem was to get away
from these high-strung, squabbling
men, to escape from this
hot, smelly little room.</p>

<p>"Captain! You must have some
idea!"</p>

<p>Somers tried to shake his feeling
of unreality. The problem,
the real problem, he told himself,
was how to stop the ship.</p>

<p>He looked around the fixed cabin
and out the porthole at the
unmoving stars. <i>We are moving
very rapidly</i>, he thought, unconvinced.</p>

<p>Rajcik said disgustedly, "Our
noble captain can't face the situation."</p>

<p>"Of course I can," Somers objected,
feeling very light-headed
and unreal. "I can pilot any course
you lay down. That's my only
real responsibility. Plot us a
course to Mars!"</p>

<p>"Sure!" Rajcik said, laughing.
"I can! I will! Engineer, I'm going
to need plenty of fuel for this
course&mdash;about ten tons! See that
I get it!"</p>

<p>"Right you are," said Watkins.
"Captain, I'd like to put in a requisition
for ten tons of fuel."</p>

<p>"Requisition granted," Somers
said. "All right, gentlemen, responsibility
is inevitably circular.
Let's get a grip on ourselves. Mr.
Rajcik, suppose you radio Mars."</p>

<p>When contact had been established,
Somers took the microphone
and stated their situation.
The company official at the other
end seemed to have trouble
grasping it.</p>

<p>"But can't you turn the ship?"
he asked bewilderedly. "Any kind
of an orbit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. I've just explained that."</p>

<p>"Then what do you propose to
do, Captain?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I'm asking
you."</p>

<p>There was a babble of voices
from the loudspeaker, punctuated
by bursts of static. The lights
flickered and reception began to
fade. Rajcik, working frantically,
managed to re-establish the contact.</p>

<p>"Captain," the official on Mars
said, "we can't think of a thing.
If you could swing into any sort
of an orbit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't!"</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, you
have the right to try anything at
all. Anything, Captain!"</p>

<p>Somers groaned. "Listen, I can
think of just one thing. We could
bail out in spacesuits as near
Mars as possible. Link ourselves
together, take the portable transmitter.
It wouldn't give much of
a signal, but you'd know our approximate
position. Everything
would have to be figured pretty
closely&mdash;those suits just carry
twelve hours' air&mdash;but it's a
chance."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> was a confusion of
voices from the other end.
Then the official said, "I'm sorry,
Captain."</p>

<p>"What? I'm telling you it's our
one chance!"</p>

<p>"Captain, the only ship on Mars
now is the <i>Diana</i>. Her engines
are being overhauled."</p>

<p>"How long before she can be
spaceborne?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks, at least. And a
ship from Earth would take too
long. Captain, I wish we could
think of something. About the
only thing we can suggest&mdash;"</p>

<p>The reception suddenly failed
again.</p>

<p>Rajcik cursed frustratedly as
he worked over the radio. Watkins
gnawed at his mustache.
Somers glanced out a porthole
and looked hurriedly away, for
the stars, their destination, were
impossibly distant.</p>

<p>They heard static again, faintly
now.</p>

<p>"I can't get much more," Rajcik
said. "This damned reception....
What could they have been
suggesting?"</p>

<p>"Whatever it was," said Watkins,
"they didn't think it would
work."</p>

<p>"What the hell does that matter?"
Rajcik asked, annoyed. "It'd
give us something to do."</p>

<p>They heard the official's voice,
a whisper across space.</p>

<p>"Can you hear ... Suggest ..."</p>

<p>At full amplification, the voice
faded, then returned. "Can only
suggest ... most unlikely ... but
try ... calculator ... try ..."</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="363" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>The voice was gone. And then
even the static was gone.</p>

<p>"That does it," Rajcik said.
"The calculator? Did he mean the
Fahrensen Computer in our
hold?"</p>

<p>"I see what he meant," said
Captain Somers. "The Fahrensen
is a very advanced job. No one
knows the limits of its potential.
He suggests we present our problem
to it."</p>

<p>"That's ridiculous," Watkins
snorted. "This problem has no solution."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to," Somers
agreed. "But the big computers
have solved other apparently impossible
problems. We can't lose
anything by trying."</p>

<p>"No," said Rajcik, "as long as
we don't pin any hopes on it."</p>

<p>"That's right. We don't dare
hope. Mr. Watkins, I believe this
is your department."</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use?" Watkins
asked. "You say don't hope&mdash;but
both of you are hoping anyhow!
You think the big electronic god
is going to save your lives. Well,
it's not!"</p>

<p>"We have to try," Somers told
him.</p>

<p>"We don't! I wouldn't give it
the satisfaction of turning us
down!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> stared at him in vacant
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Now you're implying that machines
think," said Rajcik.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," Watkins said.
"Because they do! No, I'm not
out of my head. Any engineer will
tell you that a complex machine
has a personality all its own. Do
you know what that personality
is like? Cold, withdrawn, uncaring,
unfeeling. A machine's only
purpose is to frustrate desire and
produce two problems for every
one it solves. And do you know
why a machine feels this way?"</p>

<p>"You're hysterical," Somers
told him.</p>

<p>"I am not. A machine feels
this way because it <i>knows</i> it is
an unnatural creation in nature's
domain. Therefore it wishes to
reach entropy and cease&mdash;a mechanical
death wish."</p>

<p>"I've never heard such gibberish
in my life," Somers said. "Are
you going to hook up that computer?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I'm a human. I
keep trying. I just wanted you to
understand <i>fully</i> that there is no
hope." He went to the cargo hold.</p>

<p>After he had gone, Rajcik
grinned and shook his head. "We'd
better watch him."</p>

<p>"He'll be all right," Somers
said.</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe not." Rajcik
pursed his lips thoughtfully. "He's
blaming the situation on a machine
personality now, trying to
absolve himself of guilt. And it
<i>is</i> his fault that we're in this spot.
An engineer is responsible for all
equipment."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you can put
the blame on him so dogmatically,"
Somers replied.</p>

<p>"Sure I can," Rajcik said. "I
personally don't care, though.
This is as good a way to die as
any other and better than most."</p>

<p>Captain Somers wiped perspiration
from his face. Again the
notion came to him that the problem&mdash;the
<i>real</i> problem&mdash;was
to find a way out of this hot,
smelly, motionless little box.</p>

<p>Rajcik said, "Death in space
is an appealing idea, in certain
ways. Imagine an entire spaceship
for your tomb! And you have
a variety of ways of actually dying.
Thirst and starvation I rule
out as unimaginative. But there
are possibilities in heat, cold, implosion,
explosion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is pretty morbid," Somers
said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I'm a</span> pretty morbid fellow,"
Rajcik said carelessly. "But
at least I'm not blaming inanimate
objects, the way Watkins
is. Or permitting myself the luxury
of shock, like you." He studied
Somers' face. "This is your
first real emergency, isn't it, Captain?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Somers answered
vaguely.</p>

<p>"And you're responding to it
like a stunned ox," Rajcik said.
"Wake up, Captain! If you can't
live with joy, at least try to extract
some pleasure from your
dying."</p>

<p>"Shut up," Somers said, with
no heat. "Why don't you read a
book or something?"</p>

<p>"I've read all the books on
board. I have nothing to distract
me except an analysis of your
character."</p>

<p>Watkins returned to the cabin.
"Well, I've activated your big
electronic god. Would anyone
care to make a burned offering
in front of it?"</p>

<p>"Have you given it the problem?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I decided to confer
with the high priest. What shall
I request of the demon, sir?"</p>

<p>"Give it all the data you can,"
Somers said. "Fuel, oxygen, water,
food&mdash;that sort of thing.
Then tell it we want to return to
Earth. Alive," he added.</p>

<p>"It'll love that," Watkins said.
"It'll get such pleasure out of rejecting
our problem as unsolvable.
Or better yet&mdash;insufficient
data. In that way, it can hint
that a solution is possible, but just
outside our reach. It can keep us
hoping."</p>

<p>Somers and Rajcik followed
him to the cargo hold. The computer,
activated now, hummed
softly. Lights flashed swiftly over
its panels, blue and white and
red.</p>

<p>Watkins punched buttons and
turned dials for fifteen minutes,
then moved back.</p>

<p>"Watch for the red light on
top," he said. "That means the
problem is rejected."</p>

<p>"Don't say it," Rajcik warned
quickly.</p>

<p>Watkins laughed. "Superstitious
little fellow, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"But not incompetent," Rajcik
said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Can't you two quit it?" Somers
demanded, and both men
turned startedly to face him.</p>

<p>"Behold!" Rajcik said. "The
sleeper has awakened."</p>

<p>"After a fashion," said Watkins,
snickering.</p>

<p>Somers suddenly felt that if
death or rescue did not come
quickly, they would kill each
other, or drive each other crazy.</p>

<p>"Look!" Rajcik said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;light</span> on the computer's
panel was flashing green.</p>

<p>"Must be a mistake," said Watkins.
"Green means the problem
is solvable within the conditions
set down."</p>

<p>"Solvable!" Rajcik said.</p>

<p>"But it's impossible," Watkins
argued. "It's fooling us, leading
us on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be superstitious," Rajcik
mocked. "How soon do we get
the solution?"</p>

<p>"It's coming now." Watkins
pointed to a paper tape inching
out of a slot in the machine's
face. "But there must be something
wrong!"</p>

<p>They watched as, millimeter
by millimeter, the tape crept out.
The computer hummed, its lights
flashing green. Then the hum
stopped. The green lights blazed
once more and faded.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Rajcik
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"It's finished," Watkins said.</p>

<p>"Pick it up! Read it!"</p>

<p>"You read it. You won't get <i>me</i>
to play its game."</p>

<p>Rajcik laughed nervously and
rubbed his hands together, but
didn't move. Both men turned
to Somers.</p>

<p>"Captain, it's your responsibility."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Captain!"</p>

<p>Somers looked with loathing at
his engineer and navigator. <i>His</i>
responsibility, everything was <i>his</i>
responsibility. Would they never
leave him alone?</p>

<p>He went up to the machine,
pulled the tape free, read it with
slow deliberation.</p>

<p>"What does it say, sir?" Rajcik
asked.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;possible?" Watkins
urged.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Somers said. "It's
possible." He laughed and looked
around at the hot, smelly, low-ceilinged
little room with its
locked doors and windows.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Rajcik shouted.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Somers</span> said, "You figured a
few thousand years to return
to the Solar System, Rajcik?
Well, the computer agrees with
you. Twenty-three hundred years,
to be precise. Therefore, it has
given us a suitable longevity
serum."</p>

<p>"Twenty-three hundred years,"
Rajcik mumbled. "I suppose we
hibernate or something of the
sort."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Somers said calmly.
"As a matter of fact, this serum
does away quite nicely with
the need for sleep. We stay awake
and watch each other."</p>

<p>The three men looked at one
another and at the sickeningly
familiar room smelling of metal
and perspiration, its sealed doors
and windows that stared at an
unchanging spectacle of stars.</p>

<p>Watkins said, "Yes, that's the
sort of thing it would do."</p>
